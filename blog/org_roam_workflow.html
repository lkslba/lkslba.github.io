As every man of culture I like to procastinate with optimizing some system of mine instead of actually get work done. As I recently dove into the emacs-org-mode-rabbit-hole I of course stumbled onto org-roam and was immediatly captured. Although I was never a big note-taker I see the potential of having a database of resources and thoughts to fall back onto. I read a lot, watch youtube-videos and listen to podcasts but I can't help but forget most of it. Ralph Waldo Emerson always conforted me with his famous quote, but it still bothers me that I keep forgetting a lot of really useful information, and maybe even worse, I often forget where to refind the information. Org Roam may be an appealing solution, only time will tell. For now I want to share my configuration and workflow using mostly <a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs</a>  and <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.
