#+title: Setting up this Website with Emacs Org-mode
#+date: <2023-03-07 Tue>

The HTML files which make up this site were automatically generated by EMACS Org-Mode's publishing function. As a total beginner with Emacs I wanted to share my struggle creating this website so other people - maybe you - can learn from my mistakes.

* Why use ORG-Mode?
Today there are a lot of (easy) ways getting your Website online. So why choose writing it in EMACS over using Wordpress for Example? My reasons at least are:

- Browser-Editors are overkill: Wordpress and all the other are good and mighty tools. But I just want a little place in the www where I can put my writing and be found by others. I don't need forms, comment-sectins, fancy animations, selling-capability and so on. Org-Mode is perfect for a simple, text-focused website as EMACS is in its heart a text editor.
- Cheap: Currently, I don't pay anything for this website. Not for the building-part and not for the hosting part.
- Easy (kind of): The set up takes a few hours, but now I don't have to write any HTML or CSS when modifying or extending the site. I do everything form EMACS.
- Fun: It's just fun exploring the capabilities of EMACS org-mode and simultaously writing for my website.

* Basic setup
I use doom EMACS (v28.2) and Org mode v9.5.5. If you have never heard about EMACS or Org, you can think of EMACS as the editor and org as a kind of markup language. Org has a integrated publishing package, ox-pubish. After generating the HTML files with ox-publish into a designated website directory, I commit the changes to my remote Github repository where they automatically get posted online through Github pages.

| editor          | doom EMACS     |
|-----------------+----------------|
| markup language | org-mode       |
| syncing         | git            |
| hosting         | Github (pages) |

* Publishing configuration
The following code is from the publishing file 'build-site.el', which contains all the necessary publishing instuction for org publish and enables also system independant publishing as it specifies all needed packages and downloads them if not already done.

#+caption: Here the necessary dependencies are checked and if needed installed:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "./.packages"))
(setq package-archives '(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
                         ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))

;; Initialize the package system
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))

;; Install dependencies
(package-install 'htmlize)

;; Load the publishing system
(require 'ox-publish)

      org-html-head-include-scripts nil       ;; Use our own scripts

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Generate the site output
(org-publish-all t)

(message "Build complete!")
;;; build-site.el ends here

#+end_src

Then I run the file with the shell script 'build.sh' which I copied 1:1 from SystemCrafters, see the sources for visiting his excellent website. The created html-files are saved in the 'public' folder. I then just manually push the directory onto github where 'public' is used as root directory for this page. If you want to do the same, I agein direct you to the excellent guide form SystemCrafters.net.
